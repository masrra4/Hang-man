# Hang-man
 Repository: `hangman`
- Type of Challenge: `Learning`
- Duration: `1 day`
- Deadline: `27/05/2022 4:00 PM`
- Team challenge : `solo

Steps to do the project:
1-define the variables:

lives=5
wrongly_guessed_letters=[]
possible_word=['becode', 'learning', 'mathematics', 'sessions']
will_gussed_letter=[]
turn_count=0
error_count=0
word_to_find=[]
word_complition='-'*len(possible_word)

2-useing  the class method to provide an easy way of keeping the data members and methods together in one place which helps in keeping the program more organized.
the name of the class is hangman ,and inside it I used some functions and for loops .

3-The benifit of using the function is:
to  allow the same piece of code to run multiple times and thats why I use it in the project.
in this project I used 3 functions to do that


4-after that I used the for loope to pass for each letter in the word and in this project I used it four times because  the player should guess four words .

and that's it .
